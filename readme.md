# smol play

A small and simple player.

I thought I would go back to basics and start with something so incredibly simple that even I
could deploy it.

Also I suppose it is important that this player is deployable indepently of any backend GUIs
that may be developed in the future.

## Install Guide

1. Drop these files onto your public dir

2. Copy `example_library.json` and rename `library.json`;

   2a. enter Title and Filename as a minimum for each track.


## Todo

- [x] footer that links to this repo
- [x] a nice colour scheme

- [ ] filter by tags
- [ ] filter by album
- [ ] an all tracks button
- [ ] when playing a track, show its album and tag information that is clickable

- [ ] download button
- [ ] share button (current playlist filtered)

- [ ] make it look somewhat presentable
