# smol play

A small and simple player.

I thought I would go back to basics and start with something so incredibly simple that even I
could deploy it.

Also I suppose it is important that this player is deployable indepently of any backend GUIs
that may be developed in the future.

## Install Guide

1. Drop these files onto your public dir

2. Copy `example_library.json` and rename `library.json`;

   2a. enter Title and Filename as a minimum for each track.


### Todo

#### Soundboard Mode

For people who are not looking for less of a juke box and more for some nice tiles to press to play ambient tracks this is what is next in the pipeline.

- [ ] toggle list view vs large button view
- [ ] allow images to be set for background of tracks

Possible this could be an entirely new template, but I would like this to be toggleable.

Would it be helpful to have both "kinds" of albums listed together, and on opening a track that is an
ambient collection, have it change styles to the tile view?

#### Deployment & Functionality

- [ ] make a how to video about how to deploy and use
- [ ] simplify this document
